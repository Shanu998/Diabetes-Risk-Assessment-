# Diabetes-Risk-Assessment

## INTRODUCTION
This dashboard presents a comprehensive risk assessment of diabetes based on a dataset of 2,768 patients. The analysis focuses on key indicators such as BMI, glucose levels, insulin, skin thickness, and Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF), segmented by age groups and pregnancy count. The visualization provides insights into population distribution, clinical metrics, and outcome patterns to assist in identifying high-risk groups and informing public health strategies.


## KEY HIGHLIGHTS
- Patient Demographics: Total of 2,768 patients with an average age of 33 years.

- Clinical Metrics: Average BMI of 32.1 and an average glucose level of 121.1.

- Diabetes Outcome Distribution: 34% of the population are diabetic, while 66% are non-diabetic.

- Age Group Insights: The 30-39 age group has the largest patient representation, with notable glucose and BMI variances across other age segments.

- Pregnancy Count Analysis: Increased number of pregnancies correlates with higher glucose levels and BMI averages.

- Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF): The DPF tends to peak within the 70-79 age group among diabetics.

- Insulin & Skin Thickness Trends: Variation in insulin levels and skin thickness across different age groups and pregnancy counts indicate potential risk factors tied to physiological changes.


## TOOLS
- Microsoft Excel: Used for comprehensive data analysis and visualisation.

## TECHNIQUE AND SKILLS

- Data Transformation: Utilizing Excel for data cleaning, filtering, and shaping to ensure data quality and consistency.

- Data Visualization: Designing interactive charts, graphs, and maps to effectively communicate insights.

- Dashboard Design: Implementing best practices for layout, color schemes, and user navigation to enhance user experience.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
- Targeted Intervention for High-Risk Age Groups: Focus on individuals in the 40-59 age bracket where insulin resistance indicators are significantly high.

- Monitoring Pregnant Women with High BMI: Increased glucose and BMI levels in patients with higher pregnancy counts suggest the need for closer monitoring during prenatal care.

- Community Awareness Programs: The significant proportion of non-diabetic individuals with borderline glucose levels suggests opportunities for preventive health education.

- Routine Screening for Older Adults: The spike in DPF among older age groups (70-79) indicates a necessity for more frequent diabetic screenings in senior populations.

- Data-Driven Clinical Decisions: Encourage healthcare providers to leverage data dashboards like this for patient stratification and proactive care management.
